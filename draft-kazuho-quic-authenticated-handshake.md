--- abstract

This document explains a variant of QUIC protocol version 1 that uses the ESNI
Keys to authenticate the Initial packets thereby making the entire handshake
tamper-proof.

# Introduction

As defined in Secure Using TLS to Secure QUIC [QUIC-TLS], QUIC version 1
[QUIC-TRANSPORT] protects the payload of every QUIC packet using AEAD making
the protocol injection- and tamper-proof, with the exception being the Initial
packets.  Initial packets are merely obfuscated because there is no shared
secret between the endpoints when they start sending the Initial packets
against each other.

However, when Encrypted Server Name Indication for TLS 1.3 [TLS-ESNI] is used,
a shared secret between the endpoints can be used for authentication from the
very first packet of the connection.

This document introduces an additional authenticated data (AAD) construction
that includes a secret value derived from the ESNI shared secret so that third
parties cannot inject or alter the packets.

## Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

# Protocol Version Number

The long header packets exchanged using this specification carry the QUIC
version number of 0xXXXXXXXX (TBD).

# Initial Packet Authentication Secret

QUIC version 1 uses the packet header as the AAD input of the packet
protection.  In this variant, the AAD used for the Initial packet is an
concatenation of the packet header and an authentication secret that is
derived from the shared ESNI secret using the following computation:

~~~
   initial_auth_secret = HKDF-Expand-Label(Zx, "quic initial auth",
                                           Hash(ESNIContents), 16)
~~~

AAD for other types of packets are identical to that of QUIC version 1.

# Considerations

## Abnormal Use of AEAD cipher

The design principle of AEAD is to provide authentication and encryption as a
single function.

The proposed approach goes against the principle. A server is expected to
decrypt the packet payload, derive the shared ESNI secret and the Initial
packet authentication secret from the contained Client Hello message, then
validate the AEAD tag.

We can consider using AES-CTR for Initial packet payload and HMAC for
authentication, at the cost of diverging further from QUIC version 1. Using a
hash function that is selected by the ESNI key exchange might be more generic
than relying on GCM for authentication.

We can also consider adding a small checksum to the Initial packets so that
the server can determine if the packet is corrupt. The downside is that the
endpoints would be required to calculate the checksum for Initial packets that
carry server's messages and ACKs as well, even though the correctness of the
packet can be verified using the ordinary procedure of AEAD.

## Use of Different QUIC Version Number

For this specification, use of a different QUIC version number is not expected
to have negative impact on user-experience by raising the chance of version
negotiation, assuming that the distribution of the ESNI key implies that the
QUIC server supports this specification.

Use of Encrypted SNI will stick out more, because version number is an
unobfuscated field that exists at the front of the packet.
